** Share your layout **

Thanks for contributing. Please post your layout and **corresponding screenshot** to
the dedicated [HTML Clock templates](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/html-clock-plasmoid/discussions/categories/html-clock-templates)
section in [Discussions](https://github.com/MarcinOrlowski/html-clock-plasmoid/discussions).

When posting, please include the screenshot of your clock in action, so others can see what to expect.
To avoid formatting issues, please wrap it with backticks. Put:

    ```html

(three backticks and "html" text) as opening line (backticks starts at begining of line),
then put your HTML layout and conclude with three backticks (again, starting at begining of
line):

    ```

** Notes **

* Give your clock layout a name or title. That'd help others refer to the right template when needed.
* Avoid hardcoding font sizes in the layout whenever possible. This can be sometimes impossible to avoid (i.e. you want different 
  sizes for different clock elements), but if you use just single font size, please remove it so users can adjust that using widget's
  configuration dialog.
* If possible, please avoid hardcoding font names. That would make your markup shorter and will allow users to set their favourite font in 
  widget's configuration dialog.
* Did I mention to include the screenshot of your widget?
